For information, see the link:trex_manual.html[manual], especially the material up to the link:trex_manual.html#_basic_usage[Basic Usage] section.

== Emulation support

=== High level functionality

The objective is to implement client side L3 protocols i.e ARP, IPv6, ND, MLD, IGMP in order to simulate a scale of clients and servers.
This project is not limited to client protocols, but it is a good start. The project provides a framework to implement and use client protocols.

The framework is fast enough for control plane protocols and will work with TRex server. Very fast L7 applications (on top of TCP/UDP) will run on TRex server.  One single thread of TRex-EMU can achieve a high rate of client creation/teardown.
Each of the aforementioned protocol is implemented as a plugin. These plugins are self contained and can signal events one to the other, or to the framework, using an event-bus. (e.g. DHCP signals that it has a new IPv6 address).
The framework has an event driven architecture, this way it can scale. The framework also provides to a protocol plugin infrastructure, for example RPC, timers, packet parsers, simulation and more.


*The main properties*::

* Fast client creation/teardown. ~3K/sec for one thread.
* Number of active client/namespace is limited only by the memory on the server.
* Packet per second (PPS) in the range of 3-5 MPPS.
* Python 2.7/3.0 Client API exposed through JSON-RPC.
* Interactive support - Integrated with the TRex console.
* Modular design. Each plugin is self contained and can be tested on its own.
* TRex-EMU supports the following protocols:

=== TRex Architecture with TRex-EMU

[[Architecture]]
image::images/trex_arch.png[title="TRex Architecture",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/trex_arch.png"]

TRex-EMU can receive commands (RPC via JSON-RPC) from a Python client and send/receive packets via a ZMQ channel that connects it to the TRex server (RX core). Packets from the network (from a TRex server physical port) that match a filter (dynamic) are forwarded to the TRex-EMU process. Packets from the EMU process are packed into the ZMQ channel and sent directly to the TRex physical port.


=== Internal Emulation Server Architecture

image::images/emu_arch.png[title="Emulation Server Architecture",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/emu_arch.png"]

Each TRex emulation process called `thread` can have a few `Namespaces`.

Each `Namespace` must have a unique tuple key, that is composed from {physical-port, dot1q, QinQ}. The namespace key could be extended to tunnels in the future. 

Each `Client` can be associated with one `Namespace`.

Each `Protocol Plugin` can attach an opaque object at each level (thread, namespace, client) and run the protocol logic at that level. For example, DHCPv6 will be run mainly at the client level, while MLDv2 will run on a namespace context.

Different plugins and frameworks can communicate through an event bus. A plugin can register on a topic (Subscriber) and can send an event on a specific topic (Publisher) (e.g. DHCPv6 can send an event upon a change of a source IPv6).

Something to note in this model is that `Clients` can share information on the same `Namespace`, reducing multicast, broadcast and generally packet duplication.

image::images/emu_arp.png[title="ARP Plugin",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/emu_arp.png"]

The previous figure shows a shared IPv4 default gateway for many clients, which is resolved once and shared with all the respective clients. So ARP broadcast packets do not need to be duplicated for each client.
In this example, if all the clients had the same default gateway 16.0.0.1, we will have only one entry in the ARP cache table and each client will have a pointer to it. This is an example on how scaling in the number of clients can be achieved.  


=== EMU main objects 

* *Thread*: Includes a few namespaces on different physical ports.
* *Namespace*: A separate network entity that can include a number of clients. Each namespace has a unique physical port, dot1q and QinQ tuple key.
* *Namespace key tuple*: A tuple that serves as the key of the namespace, hence must be unique per namespace.
* *Client*: Represents a separate network node in the namespace. For example a different laptop or server. Each node can have only one IPv4 source address, and a few IPv6 global and local IPv6 addresses.
* *Plugin*: Implements a protocol logic or a tunnel logic. Could attach an opaque object to a thread, namespace and client object and use the framework API.

=== EMU Thread 

This object handles the following entities:

* RPC over JSON-RPC/ZMQ
* Timer wheel
* Event bus
* ZMQ veth for TX/RX packets
* Parser to dispatch packets to plugins
* Manages a set of namespaces
* Manages fast zero copy packet allocation (mbuf) - inspired by BSD
* Counters engine

----

* Associated only with one namespace
* `CClientInfo` is the information retrieved for each client in an incoming RPC command
** `CClientDg` is the IPv4 and/or IPv6 resolved default gateway using IPv6 ND and/or ARP
** `Ipv6Router` is the IPv6 router advertised information
* `CClientCmd` is the JSON-RPC information to create a new client
** `CClientCmd.Plugins` is a vector of plugins for associating protocols plugins with a client/namespace example 

`[{'arp':{'enable':True}},{'icmp':{}},'dhcp':{'keep_alive':120}]`.
In this example we enable `arp`,`icmp` and `dhcp` plugin for this client and we can provide a init configuration.

* One important limitation is that the client does not have a routing table in the first version, only a default gateway. It was done for simplicity, because the main objective is to verify a router/switch under test.
* However, clients in the same subnet can still communicate using the default gateway, as long as the default gateway has routing abilities. In the ping tutorial we show how to
ping a client in the same namespace/subnet.


== Getting Started Tutorials

The tutorials in this section demonstrate basic use cases of the TRex-EMU server.

=== Tutorial: Load TRex server, One Client with ARP/ICMP plugin 

*Goal*::

Create *one* new client with one source IPv4 configuration and ping from the router.
An ASR1K (Cisco IOS-XE) is used in the following tutorials and it is connected directly on a physical port (without a switch).


* ASR1K
** Port/Interface: (Ten1/0/0)
** IPv4: 1.1.5.1
** Subnet Mask: /24 (255.255.255.0)

* TRex EMU
** Port 0
** IPv4: 1.1.5.2
** Subnet Mask: /24 (255.255.255.0)

=== Tutorial: Ping

Needless to say, ping is the most basic utility in terms of verifying network connections. However, it can be used for benchmarking and for gathering data, such as latency.
The TRex Emu server offers the ping functionality both for ICMPv4 and ICMPv6. In this tutorial we will explore this functionality and learn the basics of how to use.

==== ICMPv4

We have the following ICMP command available in the console. (And a few more in the API)

.Console ICMPv4 Command
[source, bash]
----
emu_icmp_ping -                ICMP ping utility (per client).
----

In order to be able to use the ping, first let us understand the setup by looking at the following figure:

The ASR1K is connected on port Te0/0/0 to all the clients we will emulate. On this interface we defined 1.1.1.1/24. The next hop of the router is 1.1.1.2.
All the clients we will emulate, will start from 1.1.1.3 and their default gateway will be the router, meaning 1.1.1.1

image::images/icmpv4_setup.png[title="ICMPv4 Setup",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/icmpv4_setup.png"]


Let us load the profile which will emulate the clients as mentioned.

[source, bash]
----
trex>emu_load_profile -f emu/simple_icmp.py -t --ns 1 --clients 3
----

We can verify the setup by:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_show_all

Namespace #1 Information

Port | Vlan tags | Tpids |  Plugins  | #Clients
-----+-----------+-------+-----------+---------
 0   |     -     |   -   | arp, icmp |    3

Clients Information

       MAC        |  IPv4   | DG-IPv4 | MTU  |  Plugins
------------------+---------+---------+------+----------
00:00:00:70:00:03 | 1.1.1.3 | 1.1.1.1 | 1500 | arp, icmp
00:00:00:70:00:04 | 1.1.1.4 | 1.1.1.1 | 1500 | arp, icmp
00:00:00:70:00:05 | 1.1.1.5 | 1.1.1.1 | 1500 | arp, icmp
----

Let's dive into it:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_icmp_ping -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:03

Starting to ping :                                           [SUCCESS]

Progress: 100.00%, Sent: 5/5, Rcv: 5/5, Err: 0/5, RTT min/avg/max = 0.96/3.58/11.52 ms

Completed

----

Pay attention that we didn't write any parameters into the ping, so it used the default parameters, which go as follows:

** `amount` - how many echo requests to send, default value is 5
** `pace` - how many packets per second (pps) to send, default value is 1
** `dst` - destination IPv4, default value is Default Gateway
** `size` - size of the ICMP payload in bytes, default and minimal is 16 bytes.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
You can stop pinging by sending a Keyboard Interrupt with Ctrl+C.
=====================================================================

Let us see the statistics of the ICMP plugin:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_icmp_show_counters -p 0
Icmp Counters

      name        | value
------------------+------
pktTxIcmpQuery    | 5
pktRxIcmpResponse | 5
----

If we run the Emulator with the `-m` flag we can actually capture the pcap and see the packets:

image::images/icmpv4_pcap.png[title="ICMPv4 Ping Pcap Default Gateway",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/icmpv4_pcap.png"]

Pay attention to the timing being 1 second between each Echo Request.

Let us try to ping another client:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_icmp_ping -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:03 --dst 1.1.1.4 --amount 3 --size 100

Starting to ping :                                           [SUCCESS]

Progress: 100.00%, Sent: 3/3, Rcv: 3/3, Err: 0/3, RTT min/avg/max = 3.70/10.20/22.66 ms

Completed

----

Pinging works and we get replies from the other client, however this doesn't work as you would normally think it would work.

We already mentioned, that the clients have simply a default gateway, and they can't resolve clients in the same subnet.

Hence, when pinging, the next hop will always be the default gateway (in our case the router), also when the clients are in the same subnet.

From the router the Echo Request packet will be forwarded to the destination, and then from the destination back to the router.

Let us look at a capture for complete information.

image::images/icmpv4_pcap_2.png[title="ICMPv4 Ping Pcap Inside Subnet",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/icmpv4_pcap_2.png"]

Looking at the TTL we can see that the router decreases it twice, once in every direction.

Lastly, let us look at the case in which we have errors. Let us try and ping a unreachable client.

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_icmp_ping -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:03 --dst 1.1.3.1 --amount 3

Starting to ping :                                           [SUCCESS]

Progress: 100.00%, Sent: 3/3, Rcv: 0/3, Err: 3/3, RTT min/avg/max = 0.00/0.00/0.00 ms

Completed

----

The error counter sums the following errors:

** replies out of order
** replies with malformed packet
** replies with invalid latency
** replies with bad ICMPv4 identifier
** destination unreachable

For precise counters and more options you can use the API.

However, we can see the destination unreachable packets in the global ICMP counters:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_icmp_show_counters -p 0
Icmp Counters

      name              | value
------------------------+------
pktTxIcmpQuery          | 3
pktRxIcmpDstUnreachable | 3
----

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
When pinging at high rates you might note that error counter is low. This happens because we finish when the client sends it's last Echo Request,
however for destination unreachable like errors the replies arrive late.
=====================================================================

==== ICMPv6

We tried to make the pinging utilities for ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 as alike as possible.

In order to ping using ICMPv6 one must use the following command:

.Console ICMPv6 Command
[source, bash]
----
emu_ipv6_ping -                ICMPv6 ping utility (per client).
----

Let us load an IPv6 profile which will simulate some IPv6 clients:

[source, bash]
----
trex>emu_load_profile -f emu/simple_ipv6.py -t --ns 1 --clients 3
----

We will focus on the first client:

.Client number 1
[source, bash]
----
trex>emu_show_client_info -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:01 --json
{
    "ipv4_dg": "0.0.0.0",
    "ipv6_dgw": null,
    "dhcp_ipv6": "::",
    "ipv6_slaac": "2001:db8:0:2222:200:ff:fe70:1",
    "ipv4_force_mac": "00:00:00:00:00:00",
    "ipv6_force_mac": "00:00:00:00:00:00",
    "ipv6_router": {
        "dgmac": "00:00:00:01:00:02",
        "prefix": "2001:db8:0:2222::",
        "ipv6": "fe80::200:ff:fe01:2",
        "prefix_len": 64,
        "mtu": 9050
    },
    "plug_names": "ipv6",
    "ipv4_force_dg": false,
    "ipv4_mtu": 1500,
    "mac": "00:00:00:70:00:01",
    "ipv4": "0.0.0.0",
    "dg_ipv6": "::",
    "ipv6": "2001:db8:1::2",
    "ipv6_force_dg": false,
    "ipv6_local": "fe80::200:ff:fe70:1",
    "dgw": null
}
----

Also we can see the addresses that the Router has:

.ASR1K Setup
[source, bash]
----
asr1001-01> show ipv6 interface br | e down
Te0/0/0                [up/up]
    FE80::200:FF:FE01:2
    2001:DB8:0:2222::1
Te0/0/1                [up/up]
    FE80::200:FF:FE02:2
    2001:DB8:1:2222::1
----

Our clients are directly connected to Te0/0/0.

Let us start with a simple ping:

[source, bash]
----
trex>emu_ipv6_ping -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:01

Starting to ping :                                           [SUCCESS]

Progress: 100.00%, Sent: 5/5, Rcv: 0/5, Err: 0/5, RTT min/avg/max = 0.00/0.00/0.00 ms

Completed
----

We tried to ping our default gateway and got no response. In the following analysis we will understand why:

Firstly, what is our default gateway? The default gateway IPv6 is resolved in the following order:

** `dg_ipv6`
** `ipv6_router.ipv6`

Meaning, an explicitly set default gateway will take priority over a Router Advertisement (RA).

Since the `dg_ipv6` is unset we actually tried to ping the address received from the RA, `fe80::200:ff:fe01:2`.

Next let us try to understand what is the source IPv6 we used. The source IPv6 is resolved in the following order:

** `dhcp_ipv6`
** `ipv6`
** `ipv6_slaac`

Meaning, top priority is given to an DHCPv6 assigned address, then to an explicitly set IPv6 and lastly to the SLAAC resolved IPv6.
In our case the `dhcp_ipv6` is unset, and as such we will try to ping using `2001:db8:1::2` as a source address.

Let us see if the router knows our address:

.ASR1K IPv6 Routing Table
[source, bash]
----
asr1001-01>show ipv6 route

Codes: C - Connected, L - Local, S - Static, U - Per-user Static route

     via TenGigabitEthernet0/0/0, receive
C   2001:DB8:1:2222::/64 [0/0]
     via TenGigabitEthernet0/0/1, directly connected
L   2001:DB8:1:2222::1/128 [0/0]
     via TenGigabitEthernet0/0/1, receive
L   FF00::/8 [0/0]
     via Null0, receive
----

We see that indeed the router doesn't know this address, hence it won't reply.

From here we have to options:

`Option 1`:

We can use a source address that the router knows, for example the local link IPv6 of the client, or the SLAAC IPv6,

[source, bash]

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
You can use only addresses you own as source IPv6.
=====================================================================

`Option 2`:

We will add a static route in the router to the `ipv6` of the clients we generated, in the following way:

[source, bash]
----
asr1001-01(config)>ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::0/112 Te0/0/0
----

We can verify we have the route:

[source, bash]
----
asr1001-01>show ipv6 route 2001:db8:1::2
Routing entry for 2001:DB8:1::/112
  Known via "static", distance 1, metric 0
  Route count is 1/1, share count 0
  Routing paths:
    directly connected via TenGigabitEthernet0/0/0
      Last updated 00:01:07 ago

Now we can retry:

=== Tutorial: IGMPv2/v3 

*Goal*:: Add a few clients and some multicast address

TRex supports IGMPv2/v3 (RFC3376) and can maintain (add/remove) scale of multicast IPs. For IGMPv3 it supports (s,g) filter using add (s,g) and remove (s,g)

<1> `self.def_ns_plugs  =  {'igmp' : {'dmac':[0,0,0,0x70,0,1]}}` is the init JSON for the IGMP plugin. The plugin works on a namespace level (not client level) but there is need for at least *one* designator client.
This client will represent the multicast groups for all the clients on the same namespace.
In this example we took the first client MAC (`00:00:00:70:00:01`).
<2> `IGMP` plugin should be enabled in the client plugs parameter (`EMUClientObj`)

=== Tutorial: IPv6/MLDv2/DHCPV6

*Goal*:: Add clients with static IPv6 and global SLAAC IPv6 address and DHCPv6

IPv6 client side is based on the following RFCs:

* RFC 4443
* RFC 4861
* RFC 4862
* MLD1/MLDv2 RFC 3810 - support (g,s) filter for MLD2 version 

It was written from scratch so it might have some issues.

    def get_profile(self, tuneables):
        args = get_args.get_args(tuneables)
        return self.create_profile(args.ns, args.clients)


----
<1> `def_ns_plugs` add `ipv6` and `'dhcpv6' : {'dmac':[0,0,0,0x70,0,1]}`. This will add the first client as a designator for MLDv2.
<2> Client plugins add `ipv6` and `dhcpv6`

* Every client advertises all its global IPv6 addresses using NS packets and its own local-IPv6.
* MLDv2 is used (MLDv1 is supported too but less efficient) to publish the solicited multicast address for each IPv6 global address.
* DHCPv6 does not offer a default gateway, SLAAC can be used or an explicit address.

=== Tutorial: Dot1x

*Goal*:: To authenticate up to 2000 clients on one ports of C9300 switch (up to 50K per switch)


EMU can supports EAP-MD5 and EAP-MSCHAPv2 (PEAP, TTLS and EAP-TLS is not supported yet).
Multi-AUTH and Single host is supported (multicast 
and unicast)

=== Tutorial: Netflow
NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around 1996 that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface.
By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network administrator can determine things such as the source and destination of traffic, class of service, and the causes of congestion. 
A typical flow monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components:

* Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records towards one or more flow collectors.
* Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter.
* Analysis application: analyzes received flow data in the context of intrusion detection or traffic profiling, for example.

TRex EMU emulates the aforementioned flow exporter for link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3954[Netflow v9, RFC 3954] and link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7011[Netflow v10 (IPFix), RFC 7011.]

We designed our Netflow plugin to have the most generic and modular implementation that we can provide. As such we first introduce a new EMU object called `engine`.

==== Engines

Engines are instructions on how to manipulate data on a data buffer. Let's suppose we have a simple buffer of 4 bytes that represents the application identifier (`applicationID` ). We could modify
this buffer on a variety of ways such as incrementing/decrementing or randomizing the value from iteration to iteration. However that wouldn't make much sense because the values assigned by IANA for the application identifier
are not incremental, decremental or follow any rule per say. TRex is a real traffic generator, and as such we need to provide an engine that takes in consideration the distribution of real traffic in order to generate application
identifiers that would make sense. There are plenty of other data fields that need specific modification from iteration to iteration, hence we designed these engines to modify data per our needs.

Let us dive into it. Engines have 3 operations:

[source, go]
----
type FieldEngineIF interface {
    // Update updates the byte slice it receives with the new generated value.
    // It writes from the beginning of the slice.
    // If the length of the slice is shorter that the length of the variable we are
    // trying to write, it will return an error.
    // It is the responsibility of the caller to provide Update with a long enough
    // slice. It returns the number of bytes it wrote as the first integer parameter.
    Update(b []byte) (int, error)
    // GetOffset returns the offset of the packet as the interface was provided with.
    // The caller should use GetOffset to provide the interface with the correct
    // byte slice.
    GetOffset() uint16
    // GetSize() returns the size of the variable that the engine will write in
    // the slice byte the next time it will be called. In order to provide a slice
    // long enough, the caller should use GetSize.
    GetSize() uint16
}
----

Engines are defined through simple JSON dictionaries. Let us look at the following example:

[source, json]
.Simple Engine
----
{
    "engine_name": "interface",
    "engine_type": "uint",
    "params": {
        "size": 1,
        "offset": 1,
        "min": 1,
        "max": 24,
        "init": 5,
        "op": "inc",
        "step": 2
    }
}
----
* `size` represents the size of the variable that the engine will update.
* `offset` represents the offset in the byte buffer that is provided in the `Update` call.

When we call `Update` with some buffer on this engine, it will write 1 byte at offset 1. The first time we call `Update` the result will be 5 (`init` value) and then 7, 9 and so on, until we wrap around and continue again.
Possible sizes are {1, 2, 4, 8} meaning we can modify all of {uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64}.
Possible operations are {inc, dec, rand}. The `step` and `init` value can be anything on the domain range (`max` - `min` + 1).

Sometimes however, we want to generate values from a specific list of values. For this purpose we have have the following list engines.

[source, json]
.Uint List
----
{
    "engine_type": "uint_list",
    "engine_name": "uint_list_dec",
    "params":
        {
            "size": 2,
            "offset": 4,
            "op": "dec",
            "list": [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096],
            "step": 2,
            "init_index": 4
        }
}
----
In this engine we can iterate the values of the provided `list` in incremental, decremental or random order. In the first two cases the `step` and the `init_value` can be any value between 0 and the list size.
For example with this engine, at bytes 4-5 of the provided buffer (`offset=4`, `size=2`) we will write `16` (`init_index=4`) and then `4` (`op=dec` and `step=2`), `1`, `2048` and so on.


The same can be done with strings. For example we can write the following engine:
[source, json]
.String list
----
{
    "engine_type": "string_list",
    "engine_name": "string_list_inc",
    "params":
        {
            "size": 20,
            "offset": 0,
            "op": "inc",
            "list": ["TRex", "Cisco", "AVC", "EMU", "Golang", "🤩"]
        }
}
----
Pay attention that for list engines the default `step=1` and the default `init_index=0`. 


The engines we saw until here are very simple and do some simple operation. In case the operation is random it will pick a random value in the domain with uniform probability. But in order to simulate real life cases we need
fast non uniform random distribution. Hence we have the following engines:


[source, json]
.Simple Histogram
----
{
    "engine_name": "minTTL",
    "engine_type": "histogram_uint",
    "params": {
        "size": 1,
        "offset": 0,
        "entries": [
            {
                "v": 64,
                "prob": 1
            },
            {
                "v": 128,
                "prob": 2
            },
            {
                "v": 192,
                "prob": 5
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
This engine will write 1 byte at `offset` 0 of the provided buffer. It will write 64 with probability 1/8, 128 with probability 2/8 and 192 with probability 5/8.
Possible sizes for this engine type are {1, 2, 4}.
For size 8, please use `engine_type = "histogram_uint64"`. We have to thank Golang's support of generics for that.

Another type of engine would be generating values in different ranges where each range has some probability of being chosen.

[source, json]
.Range Histogram
----
{
    "engine_name": "initiatorPackets",
    "engine_type": "histogram_uint64_range",
    "params":
    {
        "size": 8,
        "offset": 0,
        "entries": [
            {
                "min": 0,
                "max": 4294967295,
                "prob": 1
            },
            {
                "min": 4294967296,
                "max": 8589934591,
                "prob": 3
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
This engine will generate an uint64 (`size` = 8) and write at `offset` 0 of the buffer a value in
[0-4294967295] with probability 1/4 and a value in [4294967296-8589934591] with probability 3/4. After one entry is picked with the given probability, the value inside that entries domain
is generated uniformly. For sizes {1, 2, 4} please use `"engine_type": "histogram_uint_range"`.

Now, let us look at an engine that picks an entry from a list with some predefined distribution.

[source, json]
.List Histogram
----
{
    "engine_name": "protocolIdentifier",
    "engine_type": "histogram_uint_list",
    "params": {
        "size": 1,
        "offset": 0,
        "entries": [
            {
                "list": [17, 6],
                "prob": 5
            },
            {
                "list": [1],
                "prob": 1
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
This engine for example can be used to modify the protocol identifier. The value 1 represents ICMP and is picked with probability 1/6.
The values 17, 6 represent UDP and TCP respectively. The entry containing this value will be picked with probability 5/6 and then one between TCP and UDP will be picked uniformly.

Time related fields need special handling and as such we created special engines for them. Time engines always come in couples and need an `Engine Manager` (will be defined shorty) to work. 
Both of the engines `time_start`, `time_end` must be always provided.

[source, json]
.Time engines
----
{
    "engine_name": "flowStartSysUpTime",
    "engine_type": "time_start",
    "params":
        {
            "size": 4,
            "offset": 0,
            "time_end_engine_name": "flowEndSysUpTime",
            "ipg_min": 10000,
            "ipg_max": 20000,
            "time_offset": 200000
        }
},
{
    "engine_name": "flowEndSysUpTime",
    "engine_type": "time_end",
    "params":
        {
            "size": 4,
            "offset": 0,
            "time_start_engine_name": "flowStartSysUpTime",
            "duration_min": 5000,
            "duration_max": 10000,
        }
}
----
The `size` of these engines can be 4 or 8 bytes.
The Inter Packet Gap (IPG) will be a random value between `ipg_min` and `ipg_max`. The `duration` of the flow will be a random value between
`duration_min` and `duration_max`. Lastly the `time_offset` can be used to provide an offset from the beginning of time. This makes time engines quite modular, as
the can be used for relative times (`time_offset = upTime`) or absolute times (`times_offset = UnixTime`).
All the values are in `milliseconds`.

To generate hosts realistically, we provide an engine for building URLs.
[source, json]
.Histogram URLs
----
{
    "engine_name": "nbar2HttpHost",
    "engine_type": "histogram_url",
    "params":

                "random_queries": true,
                "prob": 5
            },
            {
                "schemes": ["ftp"],

                "prob": 2
            },
            {
                "schemes": ["http", "https"],

Let us for a moment ignore the histogram and consider what an URL is. An URL is a combination of a `scheme` + `host` + `path` + `query`. An URL must have a `scheme` and a `host` but not
necessarily contain the other fields. The `scheme` and the `host` will be uniformly picked from the `schemes` list and the `hosts` list respectively.
A path list can be provided if the user wants to. If a path list is provided, a `path` will be picked from the path list, which implicitly contains the empty path.
`Queries` can be provided in a list as raw queries (which implicitly contains the empty query), or can be generated randomly using the `random_queries` flag. The `queries` list and the `random_queries`
flag are mutually exclusive.

Finally, the histogram picks an entry with that entries' probability, and generates an URL from that entry.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
The `histogram_url` engine is an engine that works with variable length fields for IPFix.
For example this engine will write exactly the generated URL in the provided buffer through Update.
It means that it will not pad the size, unlike `string_list` for example.
The number of bytes written in the buffer, is the first return parameter of the Update function.
The `size` parameter in this engine is an upper bound for the random queries length, or for the
longest possible URL that can be composed.
=====================================================================

Another important histogram engine is the histogram string engine. Many IPFix fields work with strings, some are of fixed length (for example 32 bytes) and some have variable length.
We created a generic engine that generates strings with a given probability and works both with fixed and variable length fields by padding if necessary. Thanks to Golang's native support of Unicode
strings, the engine will support any Unicode strings.

Let us look at a fixed length field string histogram:

                "prob": 2,
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
<1> The type of the engine is `histogram_string`
<2> The maximum byte size of the encoded string can be 32 bytes
<3> Specifies that the string should be always padded to the maximum size. This should be true for fixed length fields and false for variable length fields.
<4> Some ASCII padding value. In this case it is #. The default value is 0x00.

In this engine, the generated value will be padded to 32 bytes using the `padding_value`. By using the default padding value we get exactly the required behavior for IPFix fixed length works.

Let us look at a variable length field string histogram:

                "prob": 1,
            }
        ]
    }
}

<1> The type of the engine is `histogram_string` too.
<2> The maximum size of an allowed field.
<3> The string is not padded, it is encoded in its original length. Use this for variable length strings.
<4> Padding value can be given but it is ignored.


We will summarize the engines and their types in the following table:

==== Engine Manager

Multiple engines can be defined in the same time using a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one engine.
The engine manager is a singleton that aggregates all the engines and can be used to call all of the engines one after the other.
It has a map that maps the engines by their name to the actual engine object. It also provides aggregated error counters.

==== Netflow Plugin

The Netflow/IPFix plugin in TRex expects an init JSON upon creation of the plugin. Most of the information is provided in this init JSON, however some of the information can be modified through the API
after the plugin is loaded and transmitting. Let us take a look at an init JSON:

----
* `netflow_version`: Might be 9 or 10, notice version 9 doesn't support variable length fields or per enterprise fields. Defaults to 10.
* `dst`: The destination address. It should be a string of format host:port. For example, "127.0.0.1:8080" or "[2001:db8::1]:4739".
* `domain_id`: The observation domain ID as defined in IPFix. If not provided, it will be randomly generated.
* `generators`: A list of generators. Each generator defines a Template and operations on that template, like for example the data packets rate. Each generator contains:
** `name`: Name of the generator. This field is required.
** `auto_start`: If true will automatically start sending IPFix packets upon creation.
** `template_rate_pps`: Rate of IPFix template packets (in pps), defaults to 1.
** `rate_pps`: Rate of IPFix data packets (in pps), defaults to 3.
** `data_records_num`: Number of data records in each data packet. If not provided, it will default to the maximum number of data packets which doesn't exceed the MTU.
** `is_options_template`: Indicates if this is generator will send Options Template (True) packets or Data Template packets (False). Defaults to False.
** `scope_count`: Scope count in case of Options Template packets. Must be bigger than 0.
** `template_id`: The template ID for this generator. Must be greater than 255. This field is required. Each generator must have a unique template identifier.
** `fields`: List of fields for this generator. Fields are very much alike the fields of Netflow. Each field is represented by a dictionary.
*** `name`: Name of this field. The name is required.
*** `type`: A uint16 that is unique per type. One can consult the RFC for specific values of types.
*** `length`: Length of this field in bytes. If the value is 0xFFFF, this indicates variable length fields. Variable length fields are not supported at the moment. Variable lengths are supported only in v10.
*** `enterprise_number`: Enterprise number in case the field is specific per enterprise and the type's MSB equals 1 to indicate this is an enterprise field. Enterprise fields are supported only in v10.
*** `data`: List of bytes of size length. This will be the initial data in data packets and can be modified by the engines.
** `engines`: List of engines as described in the previous sections. This field is not mandatory in case we don't want to modify any data. However it is important that the name of each engine should be a field name, and the offset
is relative to the beginning of that field.

----
<1> For brevity purposes we have omitted the `get_init_json` function from here but it returns exactly the JSON we saw. In this line we instruct the client that it runs the IPFix plugin with the parameters in the JSON.

We can load this profile through the console:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_load_profile -f emu/simple_ipfix.py
----

Now let us see the PCAP generated. In this first picture we see that the client has two generators, the first one with `template_id = 261` and Options-Template and the second one with `template_id = 266` and Data-Template.
The Data packets for the first generator are generated with a rate of 1 pps, as specified in the init JSON. Meanwhile the Data packets for the second generator are generated with a rate of 0.5 pps. The domain identifier was specified to 7777
in the init JSON, but be careful not to create 2 clients with the same domain identifier. Options-Template and Data-Template packets are send with a default rate of 1 pps but this can be altered through the `template_rate_pps` value in the init JSON
or through the console API which we will explore soon.

image::images/ipfix1.png[title="IPFix Example",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/ipfix1.png"]

We can have a closer look at the Options Template packet and see that we have three fields as specified, the first and third being Cisco enterprise fields and the second one being the protocol identifier. The scope is 1 as specified in the init JSON.

image::images/ipfix2.png[title="IPFix Options-Template",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/ipfix2.png"]

Next, we take a closer look at the Data Template packet and see that it has 3 fields, IP version and the flowStartSysUpTime, flowEndSysUpTime fields.

image::images/ipfix3.png[title="IPFix Data-Template",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/ipfix3.png"]

Finally, let us see how the data fields change thanks to the engine. Take a look at the `engines` definition in the init JSON. The first engine, named `clientIPv4Address` modifies the last byte of this IP address by incrementing it on each record. The first three bytes will remain unchanged from the data parameter provided in the init JSON, hence will remain [16, 0, 0] or [10, 0, 0] in hexadecimal representation. The second engine generates URLs.

And indeed in the first packet which has two flows (specified in the init JSON with `data_records_num`) we see that the last byte of the client IPv4 address is incremented. We also note that the first URL generated was with a random query, and the second one from the TRexwebsite.

image::images/ipfix4.png[title="IPFix Engine",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/ipfix4.png"]

Pay attention that the profile has many parameters (tunables) that can be tuned throught the `emu_load_profile` command. We can see these parameters in the Python cod, such as `ipv6`, `dst_4`, `dst_6`, `dst_port`.
To see the complete parameters use:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_load_profile -f emu/simple_ipfix.py -t -h
----

Lastly, we added a convoluted profile with variable length, multiple generators, all types of engines, per enterprise fields etc. This profile was build based on the Netflow captures of the Application Visibility and Control (AVC) team here at Cisco.
To run this profile, please use:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_load_profile -f emu/avc_ipfix.py
----

The caps contained multiple Netflow Domain Identifiers but the test simulates only 1 client, hence 1 domain identifier at a time. To choose between the domain identifiers, one can make use of the tunables. For example:

[source,bash]
----
trex>emu_load_profile -f emu/avc_ipfix.py -t --domain_id 1024
----

Other parameters such as the Netflow destination address/port can also be changed through the tunables.

==== Netflow/IPFix Console API

Last in this section we explore the Netflow/IPFix console API. We have the following functions:

[source, bash]
----
emu_ipfix_disable_gen -        Disable an IPFix generator.
emu_ipfix_enable_gen -         Enable an IPFix generator.
emu_ipfix_get_gen_info -       Get IPFix generators information.
emu_ipfix_set_data_rate -      Set IPFix generator data rate.
emu_ipfix_set_template_rate -  Set IPFix generator template rate.
emu_ipfix_show_counters -      Show IPFix data counters data.
----


We can get information on a client, for example:

[source, bash]
----
trex(service-filtered)>emu_ipfix_get_gen_info -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:03

Let us see the counters:

We can change the data rate of any generator, for example:

=== Tutorial: Load TRex server in multi-core

EMU supports multi-core (STL and ASTF) in software mode, where the filter in done by each DP core, similar to BIRD integration.
To run in this mode, do this: 

[source,bash]
----
[bash]>sudo ./t-rex-64 -i -c 4 --software --emu 
----

from Console, you should enter `service mode filter` with mask of `emu` mode (which will forward all the supported protocols to emu server)

=== Python API 

Let us see an example of how to the Python API. More can be found on the SDK documentation.

First we need to move the mode to service mode filter to get the packets to EMU (this should be done with TRex server client STL or ASTF)

.TRex server move to filter mode 
[source, python]
----
    c_trex = STLClient()
    c_trex.connect()

    my_ports=[0,1]
    c_trex.acquire(ports=my_ports, force=True)
    c_trex.set_port_attr(promiscuous=True)
    trex_c.set_service_mode(ports = my_ports, enabled = False, filtered = True, mask = (NO_TCP_UDP_MASK | DHCP_MASK ))

----

Then we can connect to the EMU server 

.EMU API example 
[source, python]
----

    c = EMUClient(server=EMU_SERVER,
                    sync_port=4510,
                    verbose_level= "error",
                    logger=None,
                    sync_timeout=None)

    # load profile
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
            description='Simple script to run EMU profile.')
    parser.add_argument("-f", "--file", required = True, dest="file", 
                        help="Python file with a valid EMU profile.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    c.connect()

    print("loading profile from: %s" % args.file)

    # start the emu profile
    c.load_profile(filename = args.file, max_rate = 2048, tunables = '')

    # print tables of namespaces and clients
    c.print_all_ns_clients(max_ns_show = 1, max_c_show = 10)

----

This script assumes there is a TRex-EMU server running on port 4510. It connects and loads a profile with tunables and then prints all the clients. 


=== Tutorial: Debug tools

Basic debugging can be performed using the following steps:

* Traces can be taken from the TRex server, the usual way.
* To debug TRex-EMU using internal packet traces perform the following:
** Run trex server with `--emu-zmq` instead of `--emu`. This will just open the zmq channel and not load the emu server 
** Open another terminal and run `trex-emu  -m | tee /tmp/a.pcap`. It will create a file using the k12 packet format.
* To debug the RPC channel, or to see all of the RPC traffic use `trex-emu -v`.
* You can even run it remotely, but the order of the following commands is important:

[source,bash]
----
 $ sudo ./t-rex-64 -i -c 1 --iom 0 --software --emu-zmq
 $ trex-emu -m -S {trex-server-ip} | tee /tmp/a.pcap
 $ trex-console -s {trex-server-ip} --emu --emu-server {emu-server-ip}
----

=== Tutorial: ZMQ transport layer

As previously mentioned in this document, the Emulation server and the Rx Core use a ZeroMQ (ZMQ) channel in order to communicate. 

ZMQ offers different flavors of transport, with the classic one being TCP.

However, the most common use case is that the Emulation server and the TRex Core Server run on the same machine, as different processes. If this indeed is the case, we can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication[IPC] as a means of transport. 

In our findings, IPC tends to perform better than TCP, because of TCP mechanisms such as congestion control, windowing, etc..

As such, we prefer IPC over TCP. When normally running TRex with the Emulation server, the transport flavor of ZMQ will be IPC.
[source, bash]
----
 scripts$ sudo ./t-rex-64 -i -c 1 --iom 0 --software --emu
----

We can use TCP if we provide the following flag:

[source, bash]
----
 scripts$ sudo ./t-rex-64 -i -c 1 --iom 0 --software --emu --emu-zmq-tcp
----

==== Tutorial: ZMQ transport layer in debug mode

We remind that the first step to run TRex in debug mode is:
[source, bash]
----
 scripts$ sudo ./t-rex-64 -i -c 1 --iom 0 --software --emu-zmq
----
The TRex server in this case expects the Emulation server to connect using ZMQ with IPC.
However, simply running the following command will not work.
[source, bash]
----
 scripts/trex_emu$ trex-emu
----
This is because IPC uses files and for files we need permissions. Hence, in this case we must run
[source, bash]
----
 scripts$ sudo taskset -c 0 ./trex-emu
----

Note that when using TCP in debug mode we don't need these permissions and we simply can use:
[source, bash]
----
 scripts$ sudo ./t-rex-64 -i -c 1 --iom 0 --software --emu-zmq --emu-zmq-tcp
 scripts/trex_emu$ trex-emu --emu-zmq-tcp
----

== Simulator

Getting TRex-EMU to run in debug mode together with TRex can be cumbersome, especially when all one wants is to simulate some short profile and see that it works.
Imagine we are writing a profile from scratch, and we have a syntax in error in it. We will discover this only when the profile is loaded, which happens after TRex starts and after TRex-EMU starts.

If you find yourself in one of the following cases, you might consider using the simulator:

** You are implementing a new plugin and want to verify the transmitted packets.
** You are writing a new profile from scratch and want to verify it works.
** You don't require an interactive default gateway, you just need to send packets.

The EMU simulator is a straightforward tool that can simulate EMU profiles as we know them for a given duration of time. Let's take a look at it:

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ emu-sim -h
usage: sim.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-o OUTPUT] [-d DURATION] [-j JSON] [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Emu profile to simulate. (default: emu/simple_emu.py) # <1>
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output file for Emu simulation. (default:
                        emu_out.pcap) # <2>
  -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                        duration of simulation in seconds. (default: 10) # <3>
  -j JSON, --json JSON  JSON file to capture traffic, RPC, counters etc. for
                        debug purposes. (default: None) # <4>
  -v, --verbose         run Emu in verbose mode  # <5>
----
<1> Emu profile to simulate.
<2> Pcap file with the packets generated. Packets are dumped in K12 format.
<3> Duration of simulation in seconds. It might be slightly longer than the requested value.
<4> A JSON file with debug information.
<5> Emu server will be run in verbose mode.

The simulator starts TRex-EMU as a standalone server, without TRex core. This means:

** The transmitted packets are recorded and then forwarded to some dummy sink veth. Meaning, the tx packets are black holed.
** There is no rx channel, hence no packets will be received from a default gateway.

These constraints seem too substantial, but for a developer who implements a new plugin and wants to see the packets TRex-EMU is generating it is more than enough.

=== Example

Let us show an example of how to use the simulator. We are going to use a Netflow profile, since Netflow is a plugin that doesn't require any rx.

Let us use the link:{github_emu_path}/simple_ipfix.py[emu/simple_ipfix.py] profile. However we are going to make a small change. 

The Netflow plugin starts sending traffic only after the default gateway's MAC address is resolved. Since there is no rx, it can never be resolved by ARP. 
This is why we are going to set a fixed MAC address for the default gateway.

[source, python]
----
    c = EMUClientObj(mac = mac.V(),
                     ipv4 = ipv4.V(),
                     ipv6 = ipv6.V(),
                     ipv4_dg = dg_4.V(),
                     ipv4_force_dg = True, # <1>
                     ipv4_force_mac = "00:00:00:01:00:01", # <2>
                     plugs  = {'ipfix': self.get_init_json(host_port),
                               'arp': {'enable': True},
                               'ipv6': {}})
----
<1> We indicate that we are forcing the MAC address of the default gateway to be a fixed value.
<2> The value of the forced MAC.

Now let's simulate the profile for 2 seconds.

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ emu-sim -f emu/simple_ipfix.py -o out.pcap -d 2 
----

Let us take a look into the generated PCAP file:

image::images/simulated_netflow_pcap.png[title="Simulated Netflow PCAP",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/simulated_netflow_pcap.png"]

From this PCAP we can verify:

** The traffic is simulated for almost 2 seconds.
** The traffic is simulated as instructed in the profile.
** The destination MAC address is the fixed MAC address we just set.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
The simulated time will always be slightly longer than the requested duration.
This is because the operation of loading the profile and setting the 
duration in TRex-EMU is not atomic and is done in two different commands.
Hence the extra time is the time it takes the simulator to set the duration
in TRex-EMU after it loads the profile.
=====================================================================

The simulator can especially help us debug. Let's see what happens when we run it with the appropriate flag.

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ emu-sim -f emu/simple_ipfix.py -d 1 --json debug.json
----

Since the debug file is long we will show here part of it:

image::images/simulator_rpc_json.png[title="Simulator RPC json",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/simulator_rpc_json.png"]

image::images/simulator_counter_json.png[title="Simulator counters json",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/simulator_counter_json.png"]

The debug json file contains:

** RPC requests and responses
** Packets
** Counters

== FAQ 

=== I want to add more protocols, how can I do it?

The framework is written in Golang. I would start with ICMP plugin as it is the simplest example.

=== Is it possible to sync ASTF/STL clients addresses with TRex-EMU?

I would like to create 1000 clients using TRex-EMU and use the same DHCP/DHCPv6 address with ASTF/STL profile.

For STL you can use the Field engine but it is limited with the scale of ip pool. We would create a indirect table that could be filled with the information from TRex-EMU. 

For ASTF there is no support and the MAC, IPv4, IPv6 would be static.

=== Why did you write all the RFCs from scratch?

Wouldn't it be easier to use a user space TCP/IP stack for example Linux or FreeBSD?

The answer is that for traffic generation, the separation between kernel and user space presents a big challenge to our main objectives:

* Scale (e.g. high rate of client creation)
* Cohesiveness between protocols.

For example DHCP and 802.1x are implemented in user space while ARP/IPv6 ND are implemented in the kernel.
Another example, IGMP is a user space socket option. To control many IGMP clients, one needs to create many processes that open sockets to Linux namespaces and this is not scalable.

The is a big penalty in our decision. We need to write from scratch the protocols, but there are some advantages:

1. The scale is very high
2. There is no separation between kernel/user-space
3. Can manipulate the code for traffic generation purposes
4. It's fun to write in Golang


=== Why Golang and not Python or C++?

First, Golang was an experiment. You can see from the code that this is the first time the developers write in Golang. However, it is hard now to go back to C++.

Why not Python?

Python has a few drawbacks for this project:

1. Speed: x50 slower than Golang
2. Dynamic language: hard to tag and control a large code base


Why not C++?

1. Speed was not a concern and TRex-core became slow to build.
2. We wanted a scalable and more modular design as the scale in TRex-EMU is more from a functionality point of view (more protocol support, development speed etc) and not PPS.

What is missing in Golang:

1. Generic, interface{} is not enough.


=== I need to write a tunnel plugin like PPPoE/GRE, can I do it?

You can, but we should support it in the framework first.


== For Developers

As you already know the Emulation Server was written in Go. The reasons and the penalties of this choice are mentioned in the FAQ, but one of the most important reasons in which we want
to focus here is the modularity.

One of the basic laws of software design is the `Law of Simplicity`: The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces.
We wanted a simple model, taking into consideration that each protocol is self contained and independent of other protocols. This is where Go packages come into play.

Every protocol is written as a separate package and each of these packages are provided fundamentals such as:

** JSON-RPC connectivity directly to the Client
** Timers
** Counter functionality
** Testing Simulation
** Monitoring/Capture

In the rare case where these protocols, also known as plugins, need to communicate with each other they can use a provided Event Bus to pass messages.

All of this was mentioned on the Emulation Support section. This section is meant to be a more hands-on tutorial on how to write a package/plugin/protocol.


=== Tutorial: How to write a plugin/package

The best way to learn is through examples. We recently implemented a few of these plugins/packages and the `ping` package is the most basic one. We will use it as an example to take you through the details and the decisions. We will mostly focus on the fundamentals aforementioned
as they are common to all packages.

*Goal*::

Offer ping functionality both for IPv4 and IPv6.

As every good piece of software written, it all starts with the design. We want to offer the ping functionality for both IPv4/6 and as such let us understand the differences between the two.
As it happens to be the only difference is the Type Code field, and we understand that a lot of code can be shared here.

Hence, we decide to write the ping functionality in a separate package with ICMPv4/ICMPv6 making use of this package as a black box.

==== JSON-RPC functionality

The JSON-RPC commands might be a bit different. For example, ICMPv4 uses a IPv4 destination address and ICMPv6 uses a IPv6 destination address. Each of these commands will then be in
the respective package. We will show you for example the ping command RPC for both cases.

.Ping JSON-RPC Command in icmp.go
[source, go]
----
ApiIcmpClientStartPingHandler struct {
    // Amount of echo requests to send
    Amount      uint32       `json:"amount"  validate:"ne=0"`
    // Pace of sending the Echo-Requests in packets per second.
    Pace        float32      `json:"pace"    validate:"ne=0"`
    // The destination IPv4
    Dst         core.Ipv4Key `json:"dst"`
    // Timeout from last ping until the stats are deleted.
    Timeout     uint8        `json:"timeout" validate:"ne=0"`
    // Payload size in bytes
    PayloadSize uint16       `json:"payloadSize" validate:"gte=16"`
}

/* ServeJSONRPC for ApiIcmpClientStartPingHandler starts a Ping instance.
Returns True if it successfully started the ping, else False. */
func (h ApiIcmpClientStartPingHandler) ServeJSONRPC(ctx interface{}, params *fastjson.RawMessage) (interface{}, *jsonrpc.Error) {

    tctx := ctx.(*core.CThreadCtx)

    p := ApiIcmpClientStartPingHandler{Amount: ping.DefaultPingAmount,
        Pace: ping.DefaultPingPace, Dst: icmpClient.Client.DgIpv4,
        Timeout: ping.DefaultPingTimeout, PayloadSize: ping.DefaultPingPayloadSize}

    err1 := tctx.UnmarshalValidate(*params, &p)
    if err1 != nil {
        return nil, &jsonrpc.Error{
            Code:    jsonrpc.ErrorCodeInvalidRequest,
            Message: err1.Error(),
        }
    }
    // The ping logic.
}

// Register the command with its handler.
core.RegisterCB("icmp_c_start_ping", ApiIcmpClientStartPingHandler{}, true)
----

Let's cap what we need for an RPC command. We need to register the command name with a handler. This handler is a struct (a concrete type), whose fields are the JSON parameters.
This struct must have a method named `ServeJSONRPC` (to satisfy a Go interface) which `Unmarshalls` and `Validates` the JSON parameters into the struct we defined.
The IPv6 is almost the same but we will show it for the sake of being complete.

.Ping JSON-RPC Command in ipv6.go
[source, go]
----
ApiIpv6StartPingHandler struct {
    // Amount of echo requests to send
    Amount      uint32       `json:"amount"  validate:"ne=0"`
    // Pace of sending the Echo-Requests in packets per second.
    Pace        float32      `json:"pace"    validate:"ne=0"`
    // The destination IPv6
    Dst         core.Ipv6Key `json:"dst"`
    // The source IPv6
    Src         core.Ipv6Key `json:"src"`
    // Timeout from last ping until the stats are deleted.
    Timeout     uint8        `json:"timeout" validate:"ne=0"`
    // Payload size bytes
    PayloadSize uint16       `json:"payloadSize" validate:"gte=16"`
}

/* ServeJSONRPC for ApiIpv6StartPingHandler starts a Ping instance.
Returns True if it successfully started the ping, else False. */
func (h ApiIpv6StartPingHandler) ServeJSONRPC(ctx interface{}, params *fastjson.RawMessage) (interface{}, *jsonrpc.Error) {

    tctx := ctx.(*core.CThreadCtx)

    c, err := getClient(ctx, params)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    dgIpv6, dgOk := c.Client.ResolveDGIPv6()

    p := ApiIpv6StartPingHandler{Amount: ping.DefaultPingAmount,
    Pace: ping.DefaultPingPace, Dst: dgIpv6,
    Src: c.Client.ResolveSourceIPv6(), Timeout: ping.DefaultPingTimeout,
    PayloadSize: ping.DefaultPingPayloadSize}

    err1 := tctx.UnmarshalValidate(*params, &p)
    if err1 != nil {
        return nil, &jsonrpc.Error{
            Code:    jsonrpc.ErrorCodeInvalidRequest,
            Message: err1.Error(),
        }
    }
    // ping logic
}

// Register the command with its handler.
core.RegisterCB("ipv6_start_ping", ApiIpv6StartPingHandler{}, true)        // start ping
----

==== Declaring a new package

Now let us get into the ping package. Each package is defined in a new directory and every Go file in this directory contains the following package declaration:

.Ping Package declaration
[source, go]
----
// Package ping offer Echo Request-Response functionality for both ICMPv4/ICMPv6.
// Also it partially supports other type of possible responses such as Destination Unreachable.
package ping
----

Both of the ICMPv4/v6 import this package.

==== Timers

We mentioned that each plugin can use build in provided timers. We will get more into the details of that later but for now let us see the time objects.
There are 2 main objects:

.Ping struct
[source, go]
----
type Ping struct {
    timer              core.CHTimerObj     // timer object
    timerw             *core.TimerCtx      // timer wheel
    // Other fields are omitted for brevity
}
----
A timer wheel is an object of type `TimerCtx`, a timer context which is shared between many plugins.

A timer object is an object which is used to hold the concrete type as a callback and call its `OnEvent` function when needed.

For example, the following lines are taken from ping:

.Timers in ping
[source, go]
----
// NewPing creates a new Ping instance and returns a pointer to it.
func NewPing(params PingParams, ns *core.CNSCtx, pingClient PingClientIF) *Ping {
    o := new(Ping)
    // Omitted lines for brevity
    o.timer.SetCB(o, 0, 0) // set the callback to this object
    o.timerw = o.tctx.GetTimerCtx() // get the timer wheel
    //dTime is the delta time between two calls.
    dTime := time.Duration(float32(time.Second) / params.Pace)
    o.ticksPerInterval, o.pktsPerInterval = o.timerw.DurationToTicksBurst(dTime)
    o.timerw.StartTicks(&o.timer, o.ticksPerInterval)
}
----
We saw that the client provided a field named `Pace` in the ping command that specifies how many packets per second (pps) to send.
Suppose `Pace=2`, we want to send 2 packets each second. So the code that sends packets must be called every `dTime=0.5s`.
However the timer works with ticks and not with `duration.Time`, and as such we convert the time to ticks using the `DurationToTicksBurst` function.
Lastly we instruct the timer to start ticking. After 0.5 seconds have passed the timer will call the `OnEvent` function of the callback concrete type we set using `SetCB`, 
which looks like this:

.Timers in ping cont.
[source, go]
----
/* OnEvent - Event Driven call. Possible Events:
- Time to send another Echo Request
- Stop waiting for an Echo Response, after sending all Echo Requests. */
func (o *Ping) OnEvent(a, b interface{}) {
    if o.sentRequests < o.params.Amount {
        o.sendPing()
        if o.sentRequests == o.params.Amount {
            timeout := time.Duration(o.params.Timeout) * time.Second
            ticks := o.timerw.DurationToTicks(timeout)
            o.timerw.StartTicks(&o.timer, ticks)
        } else {
            o.timerw.StartTicks(&o.timer, o.ticksPerInterval)
        }
    } else {
        // Should have collected the records by now, timeout expired.
        o.OnRemove()
    }
}
----
The `OnEvent` is called every 0.5 seconds except for when we finished sending all the pings. In this case we start a timer for `Timeout` seconds to allow the user to collect the ping statistics.

Pay attention to the following two functions we used to calculate ticks:

** `DurationToTicksBurst`
** `DurationToTicks`

These two functions both calculate ticks given a `time.Duration` object but they are different. The timer works with a minimal resolution which can be calculated using the following function:

.Minimal Timer Resolution
[source, go]
----
//MinTickMsec() return how long take a one tick in msec by default it is 10
func (o *TimerCtx) MinTickMsec() uint32 {
    return uint32(o.TickDuration / time.Millisecond)
}
----

If your `time.Duration` is smaller than this minimal resolution please use the former to send bursts of packets and work at minimal resolution. Else, use the later.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
We see here a pure Event Driven architecture. This is fundamental in a scale project
such as TRex. Only this way we can achieve the extreme TX rates. If we only attempt a
blocking approach we wouldn't even get close to these rates.
=====================================================================

==== Counters

A lot of protocols have counters and statistics and our ping package is no different. We offer build in functionality for counters as well, hence no need to reinvent the wheel.

The first step is to define these counters in a new struct.

.Ping Statistics
[source, go]
----
// PingStats contains the data that will be returned to the client.
// This should be unique per each Ping Identifier.
type PingStats struct {
    requestsSent         uint32        // how many Echo Requests were sent
    requestsLeft         uint32        // how many Echo Requests are left to send
    repliesBadIdentifier uint32        // how many Echo Replies with bad identifier received
    repliesMalformedPkt  uint32        // how many malformed Echo replies were received
    repliesBadLatency    uint32        // how many Echo Replies with bad latency were received
    dstUnreachable       uint32        // how many Destination Unreachable were received
    repliesInOrder       uint32        // how many Echo Replies received in order
    repliesOutOfOrder    uint32        // how many Echo Replies received out of order
    avgLatency           time.Duration // the average latency
    avgLatencyUsec       int64         // the average latency in usec
    minLatency           time.Duration // the minimal latency
    minLatencyUsec       int64         // the minimal latency in usec
    maxLatency           time.Duration // the maximal latency
    maxLatencyUsec       int64         // the maximal latency in usec
}
----
Note that not all of these counters need to be returned to the client, some might be for internal use.
Those counters we want to return to the user we add in a database, by creating a `CCounterDb` in the following way:

.Creating a database for the stats
[source, go]
----
//Creates a database of ping stats
func NewPingStatsDb(o *PingStats) *core.CCounterDb {
    db := core.NewCCounterDb("icmp_ping_stats")
    db.Add(&core.CCounterRec{
        Counter:  &o.requestsSent,
        Name:     "requestsSent",
        Help:     "tx echo requests sent",
        Unit:     "pkts",
        DumpZero: false,
        Info:     core.ScINFO})
    // Lines omitted for brevity
    return db
}
----

The ping struct we saw before has two more fields for the counters which are initialized hte following way

.How to use counters
[source, go]
----
type Ping struct {
    cdb                *core.CCounterDb    // Counter Database for Stats
    cdbv               *core.CCounterDbVec // Database Vector
    // Other fields are omitted for brevity
}

// NewPing creates a new Ping instance and returns a pointer to it.
func NewPing(params PingParams, ns *core.CNSCtx, pingClient PingClientIF) *Ping {
    o := new(Ping)
    o.stats = new(PingStats)
    o.cdb = NewPingStatsDb(o.stats)
    o.cdbv = core.NewCCounterDbVec("icmp_ping_stats")
    o.cdbv.Add(o.cdb)
    // NOTE: Lines omitted for brevity
}
----

The counter database would have sufficed in our case. However, a big part of the functionality is offered by the database vector, hence
we hold a database vector of only one entry. We can at anytime return a JSON version of the stats:

.Convert counters to JSON
[source, go]
----
// GetPingCounters returns the Ping counters.
// The params decides things like the verbosity, filtering or whether to dump zero errors.
// The counters are updated before returning them.
func (o *Ping) GetPingCounters(params *fastjson.RawMessage) (interface{}, *jsonrpc.Error) {
    var p core.ApiCntParams
    o.updateStats()
    return o.cdbv.GeneralCounters(nil, o.tctx, params, &p)
}
----
Using the params field we can decide the granularity of the information we return, such as units, filtering, verbosity etc.

==== Testing simulation

Another basic law of software design is the `Law of Testing` which says: The degree to which you know how your software behaves is the degree to 
which you have accurately tested it.

First and foremost, our package needs to know if it is being tested or not. For example, in order to measure latency, we encode a timestamp of nanosecond resolution
when sending the packet in the payload. We simply can't test our latency calculation's correctness unless we know we are in a test simulation environment and use a fixed value in this case.
Hence, our package can do something like this:

.Knowing your environment
[source, go]
----
    if !o.tctx.Simulation {
        o.identifier = uint16(rand.Intn(0xffff))
        o.sequenceNumber = uint16(rand.Intn(0xffff))
    } else {
        o.identifier = 0x1234
        o.sequenceNumber = 0xabcd
        timestamp = 128
    }
----

Writing tests in Golang is really easy. We won't get in all of the details but we will mention the basics.

First, we can use timers in tests just like we used them in the real package, with callbacks and flags to capture and compare.

.Example of test parameters
[source, go]
----
func TestPluginIcmp3(t *testing.T) {
    a := &IcmpTestBase{
        testname:     "icmp3",
        monitor:      true,
        match:        2,
        capture:      true,
        duration:     3 * time.Minute,
        clientsToSim: 1,
        amount:       5,
        cb:           rpcQueue,
    }
    a.Run(t, true)
}
----

Secondly, we can simulate JSON-RPC requests in the following way:

.Simulating JSON-RPCs in Go
[source, go]
----
    o.tctx.Veth.AppendSimuationRPC([]byte(`{"jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method":"icmp_c_start_ping",
        "params": {"tun": {"vport":1,"tci":[1,2]}, "mac": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "amount": 5,
        "pace": 1, "dst": [16, 0, 0, 1], "payloadSize": 20},
        "id": 3}`))
----

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
For this to work, we clearly need to simulate the clients and namespaces with the 
appropriate parameters as well.
=====================================================================

The idea behind this test is to create a golden file, with a packet dump (k12 format) and counters. Afterwards, each time we run the test we compare the generated output
to the golden file.

[source, bash]
----
$:src$ go test -v emu/plugins/icmp -run 3
=== RUN   TestPluginIcmp3
 counters icmp db
pktTxIcmpQuery                 :          5
pktRxIcmpResponse              :          5
 ===
--- PASS: TestPluginIcmp3 (0.01s)
PASS
ok      emu/plugins/icmp        0.024s
----

The generated file can be found `unit-test/generated` and the expected file is found in `unit-test/expected`.

Lastly, we can monitor and see the capture: 

[source, bash]
----
$:src$ go test -v emu/plugins/icmp -run 3 --monitor 1 > /tmp/a.pcap
----


=== Transport layer

==== Intro

EMU started as a framework to implement L2/L3 protocols but as soon as we understood its potential we implemented even L7 protocols, like Netflow for example. However, L7 protocols need the transport layer.
In case of UDP, it is simple really. But in case of TCP it gets complex. We can't expect each L7 protocol to implement its own TCP or UDP layer. Hence we introduce sockets. 

Sockets can be used by plugins just like sockets of the OS. The Client Transport Context (CTX) will be loaded dynamically only when the first socket is used. It is designed that way in order to save memory in case there is no use of TCP/UDP, for example, in case of DOT1X, ICMP, etc..

The TCP logic was imported from BSD C code to native Golang (from TRex-Core).

The sockets work in an event driven architecture. This is similar to NodeJS and not Golang which uses micro-threads.


==== Tutorial: Sockets, how to?

Let us see the basic example of how to work with sockets. First step, let us create a couple of sockets:

.Socket creation example
[source, go]
----
package socketApp

import (
    "emu/core"
    "emu/plugins/transport"
)

type SocketApp struct {
    ctx  *transport.TransportCtx // client transport context
    ipv4 transport.SocketApi     // some IPv4 socket
    ipv6 transport.SocketApi     // some IPv6 socket
}

func (o *SocketApp) CreateSockets(client *core.CClient) error {
    o.ctx = transport.GetTransportCtx(client) // <1>
    var err error
    o.ipv4, err = o.ctx.Dial("udp", "48.0.0.1:80", o, nil) // <2>
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    o.ipv6, err = o.ctx.Dial("tcp", "[2001:db8::3000:1]:80", o, nil) // <3>
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    return nil
}
----
<1> Get the client transport context.
<2> Create an HTTP/UDP/IPv4 socket.
<3> Create an HTTP/TCP/IPv6 socket.

While the first two arguments of `Dial` are self explanatory, let us discuss the last two.
The last argument is an `IoctlMap` for TCP flags.
The third argument is a callback object. A socket is an interface, and in case of events in needs a callback. So in our `SocketApp` we need to implement the following three functions which will be called
by the socket in case of an event.

.Socket callbacks
[source, go]
----
func (o *SocketApp) OnRxEvent(event transport.SocketEventType) {
}

func (o *SocketApp) OnRxData(d []byte) {
}

func (o *SocketApp) OnTxEvent(event transport.SocketEventType) {
}
----

The socket API is quite simple:

.Socket API
[source, go]
----
type SocketApi interface {

    Close() SocketErr    // close the connection **after** all the tx queue was flushed
    Shutdown() SocketErr // shutdown connection immediately
    LocalAddr() net.Addr
    RemoteAddr() net.Addr
    GetCap() SocketCapType // get the capability of the socket e.g. SocketCapStream
    GetLastError() SocketErr
    SetIoctl(m IoctlMap) error // set ioctl options to the socket e.g. {"no_delay":0}
    GetIoctl(m IoctlMap) error // get the value for each key
    Write(buf []byte) (err SocketErr, queued bool)
    GetL7MTU() uint16       // Returns the L7 MTU.
    IsIPv6() bool           // Returns True if the IP layer is IPv6, False if it is IPv4.
    GetSocket() interface{} // return internal raw socket *TcpSocket for testing
}
----

The next step in our tutorial is to implement a simple function in our `SocketApp` that writes in the socket. The socket API offers a `Write` function which we can call.
But unfortunately it is not that simple. Before calling `Write` on the socket we must make sure that the destination MAC address is resolved. This isn't trivial since the ARP request might take some time.
In case the MAC address is not resolved, the writing will fail.
Fortunately, we will get an event in case of resolve. Let's review our `SocketApp`. We should edit our struct to contain two new flags: 

[source, go]
----
type SocketApp struct {
    ctx         *transport.TransportCtx // client transport context
    ipv4        transport.SocketApi     // some IPv4 socket
    ipv6        transport.SocketApi     // some IPv6 socket
    dg4Resolved bool                    // DG for IPv4 resolved
    dg6Resolved bool                    // DG for IPv6 resolved
}
----

Upon creation of our app we will register for an event in case of resolve:

.Resolve event registration
[source, go]
----
func CreateSocketApp(ctx *core.PluginCtx) *SocketApp {
    o := new(SocketApp)
    o.InitPluginBase(ctx, o)              // Init base object
    var socketAppEvents = []string{core.MSG_DG_MAC_RESOLVED}
    o.RegisterEvents(ctx, socketAppEvents, o) // Register events, only if they exist
}

func (o *SocketApp) OnEvent(msg string, a, b interface{}) {
    switch msg {
    case core.MSG_DG_MAC_RESOLVED:
        bitMask, ok := a.(uint8)
        if !ok {
            // failed at type assertion
            return
        }
        resolvedIPv4 := (bitMask & core.RESOLVED_IPV4_DG_MAC) == core.RESOLVED_IPV4_DG_MAC
        resolvedIPv6 := (bitMask & core.RESOLVED_IPV6_DG_MAC) == core.RESOLVED_IPV6_DG_MAC
        if !o.dg4Resolved && resolvedIPv4 {
            o.dg4Resolved = true
        }
        if !o.dg6Resolved && resolvedIPv6 {
            o.dg6Resolved = true
        }
    }
}
----

Now we can implement our simple Write function:

.Writing in the socket
[source, go]
----
func (o *SocketApp) Write(msg []byte) (err4, err6 transport.SocketErr) {
    if o.dg4Resolved {
        err4, _ = o.ipv4.Write(msg)
    }
    if o.dg6Resolved {
        err6, _ = o.ipv6.Write(msg)
    }
    return err4, err6
}
----

For a more detailed and complete example, we ask you to explore the `transport_example` plugin.

==== Transport Counters

The TCP/UDP counters can be inspected using the console:

[source, bash]

=== Proxy

==== Intro

Take a look again at the TRex architecture as shown in <<Architecture>>. The EMU communicates with the TRex core through a ZMQ tunnel which can run on top of IPC or TCP.
The packets that the EMU generates are sent to the RX core of the TRex server through this ZMQ tunnel, and from there to the NIC.
This architecture makes sense in production. When talking scale, we indeed need this fast but long path.

However, when developing, we need to check correctness and not only scale. To check correctness, the previous architecture proves to be burdensome.
Take for example the ICMP plugin we discussed in depth in this document. To verify it works, we pinged a router. Can't we ping the machine in which the EMU runs and expect it to ping us back?

Hence we introduce the Proxy. The Proxy is a small proxy build in Golang, which can run in any Linux distribution.
The Proxy installs a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP[TAP] in the machine it runs. It then opens two ZMQ channels with the EMU, just like the RX of the TRex core.

The architecture looks like this:

image::images/proxy_arch.png[title="Proxy Architecture",align="left",width={p_width}, link="images/proxy_arch.png"]

NOTE: The Proxy runs on the same machine as the Kernel. The EMU doesn't necessarily.

==== Tutorial: Ping

In this simple tutorial we will show you how you can ping with ease using this architecture. We will create a TAP interface whose IPv4 configuration will be 11.0.0.1/24.

Then we will use the EMU to emulate a client with IPv4 of 11.0.0.2 and default gateway of 11.0.0.1. Then we will ping the Kernel from the EMU.

First we create the TAP:

link:{github_emu_repo}/scripts/mktap[scripts/mktap]

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ sudo ./mktap
----

We can verify that the TAP is created:

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ ifconfig tap0
tap0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 8a:48:87:ed:00:0b
          inet addr:11.0.0.1  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:500
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)
----

NOTE: The `mktap` script adds a iptable ACCEPT rule. This is necessary in our setups which have firewall rules, otherwise the Kernel will drop the incoming packets. The rule is deleted in the `rmtap` script.

On the same terminal window, we can run the Proxy. If this is the first time you are running it, make sure the proxy is compiled:

[source, bash]
----
src$ go install cmd-proxy/trex-emu-proxy.go
----

link:{github_emu_repo}/scripts/proxy[scripts/proxy]

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ sudo ./proxy
----

Next we run the EMU. I will be running it in the same machine and with IPC hence the flag `-S` will have a localhost address. As aforementioned, you can run it any machine and specify the address with -S, but if you work
remote remember to use TCP instead of IPC. Same here, if this is the first time you are running it, make sure the EMU is compiled:

[source, bash]
----
src$ go install cmd/trex-emu.go
----

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ sudo ./trex-emu -S 127.0.0.1
----

NOTE: The `trex-emu` file is found in the scripts folder of TRex-Core. We need `sudo` only because we are using IPC. If we use TCP instead we can run the Golang executable file from the EMU repo directly without root
permissions.

Now let us connect a TRex console to the EMU server.
[source, bash]
----
scripts$ ./trex-console --emu-only-server
----

The `--emu-only-server` tells the console not to look for a running TRex Core instance. If we specify it without parameters, it will look for the EMU server in localhost, but we can specify any address, for 
example `--emu-only-server 192.168.1.1`. Since I am running everything in the same machine, specifying the flag is enough.

NOTE: The console is found in the scripts folder of the TRex-Core repo.

Next, we load from the console a simple EMU profile which will create a client with IPv4 11.0.0.2 and default gateway 11.0.0.1 (TAP).

[source, bash]
----
emu>emu_load_profile -f emu/simple_icmp_local.py -t --clients 1
----

We can verify this by:

[source, bash]
----
emu>emu_show_all
Namespace #1 Information

Port | Vlan tags | Tpids |              Plugins               | #Clients
-----+-----------+-------+------------------------------------+---------
 0   |     -     |   -   | arp, icmp, ipv6, transe, transport |    1

Clients Information

       MAC        |   IPv4   | DG-IPv4  | MTU  |              Plugins
------------------+----------+----------+------+-----------------------------------
00:00:00:70:00:02 | 11.0.0.2 | 11.0.0.1 | 1500 | arp, icmp, ipv6, transe, transport

26.25 [ms]
----

Now let us ping the default gateway (Kernel TAP):

[source, bash]
----
emu>emu_icmp_ping -p 0 --mac 00:00:00:70:00:02

Starting to ping :                                           [SUCCESS]

Progress: 100.00%, Sent: 5/5, Rcv: 5/5, Err: 0/5, RTT min/avg/max = 0.72/1.29/3.43 ms

Completed
----

And finally, after stopping the Proxy, we can remove the TAP interface:

link:{github_emu_repo}/scripts/rmtap[scripts/rmtap]
[source, bash]
----
scripts$ sudo ./rmtap
----

==== Tutorial: TCP echo server

ICMP is a simple example to make sure everything works, but the purpose of the Proxy is to offer us as developers the correctness of the Kernel and its networking protocols.
Anyone can implement a Echo Response server, but implementing the TCP stack is another story. The Proxy can be used to verify any protocol. Take for example Netflow. EMU implements the Netflow client side, but we
need to test with a real collector. We can install an open source Netflow collector on top of the Linux Kernel and verify the correctness of EMU implementation.

Here we will show the idea with a simpler example. We will run a basic TCP echo server on the proxy machine and emulate TCP traffic with one of the EMU clients.

NOTE: This time we will use ZMQ over TCP instead of ZMQ over IPC for the sake of completeness.

First, let's make the tap:

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ sudo ./mktap
----

Then we run the Proxy with TCP over ZMQ:

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ sudo ./proxy --emu-zmq-tcp
----

Then, we run the EMU with TCP over ZMQ. Pay attention that we can run this from the EMU repository and there is no need for root permissions.

[source, bash]
----
src$ ../bin/trex-emu --emu-zmq-tcp -S 127.0.0.1
----

Next, let's take a look at the simple TCP echo server:

[source, go]
----
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

var port = "0.0.0.0:9001"

func echo(conn net.Conn) {
    r := bufio.NewReader(conn)
    for {
        line, err := r.ReadBytes(byte('\n'))
        if err == nil {
            conn.Write(line)
        } else {
            break
        }
    }
    conn.Close()
}

func main() {
    l, err := net.Listen("tcp", port)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("ERROR", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }

    for {
        conn, err := l.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("ERROR", err)
            continue
        }
        go echo(conn)
    }
}
----

The server listens at port 9001 and simply echoes back whatever it receives.

Let's compile the server:

[source, bash]
----
src$ go install cmd-test/tcp-server/tcp_server.go
----

Now, let's run it:

[source, bash]
----
src$ ../bin/tcp_server
----

Next, we will connect the console to the EMU server and emulate one client which sends TCP traffic at port 9001.

[source, bash]
----
scripts$ ./trex-console --emu-only-server
----

Let's add one client which makes use of the `transe` plugin. This plugin is a simple plugin which sends TCP traffic. The name derives from tranport example.

We can see the relevant configuration from the link:{github_emu_path}/simple_icmp_local.py[simple_icmp_local.py] profile here:

[source, python]
----
        self.def_c_plugs  = {
                            'arp': {},
                            'icmp': {},
                            'ipv6': {},
                            'transport': {},
                            'transe': {'addr':'11.0.0.1:9001', 'size':100000, 'loops':100}
                             }
----

[source, bash]
----
emu>emu_load_profile -f emu/simple_icmp_local.py -t --clients 1
----

We can see the counters:

[source, bash]
----
emu>emu_transe_show_counters -p 0
Transe Counters

   name     |  value
------------+---------
pktClient   | 1
rxByteTotal | 10000000
txByteTotal | 10000000
pktRxEvent  | 7000
pktTxEvent  | 100

5.38 [ms]
----

From the client's counters we see that the TCP server running on top of the Linux Kernels, echoes back. We can see this even better if we run the EMU in monitor mode, but we will leave this as an exercise for the reader.
